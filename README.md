# Program Description – Singly Linked List in C

This program is a simple and practical implementation of a singly linked list using the C programming language. It covers the basic operations such as inserting a new node, deleting a node based on its value, and displaying the contents of the list (also known as traversal). The main objective of this task was to understand how linked lists work internally, and how we can manage memory dynamically in C to create and manipulate data structures.

I wrote and tested this program using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), which is a user-friendly and lightweight code editor. It comes with features like syntax highlighting, debugging, and integrated terminal, which made the development process much easier. To compile and run the program, I used the GCC compiler (MinGW) which works smoothly with VS Code on Windows. However, this code can be compiled on any C compiler such as Turbo C++, Code::Blocks, or Linux GCC as well.

The structure of the program is modular — that means each operation (insert, delete, and traverse) is written as a separate function, making the code cleaner and easier to understand or modify later. The data structure used here is a singly linked list, where each node contains an integer data value and a pointer to the next node. Nodes are created dynamically using malloc() so the list can grow and shrink during execution depending on user input.

# operations Used:

Insertion: Adds a new node to the end of the list.

Deletion: Removes the first node found with the value entered by the user.

Traversal: Prints the elements of the list from the beginning to the end.

The program also includes a simple menu-driven interface so the user can interact with the list through the console. It asks for user input to choose an operation, and based on the selection, it performs the required action. If the user tries to delete a value that isn’t in the list or view an empty list, it handles those cases with proper messages, making the experience more intuitive.

# Tools & Concepts Used:

C programming language

Pointers and structures (struct)

Dynamic memory allocation using malloc()

VS Code editor with GCC compiler

Basic console input/output functions

# Where It Can Be Applied:

This kind of program is very useful in learning environments like:

Data Structures labs

Internship tasks (like this one)

Academic mini-projects

Preparing for coding interviews

Linked lists are widely used in software development for managing data in real time.In real-world systems, they are used in applications like memory management, file systems, and undo features in editors.

# Conclusion:

The program provides a functional and modular implementation of a singly linked list using the C programming language. It efficiently demonstrates fundamental operations such as insertion at the end, deletion of a specific node, and traversal of the entire list. Each operation is handled through separate functions, ensuring code clarity and reusability. The use of structures and dynamic memory allocation allows the list to grow and shrink as needed during runtime. Overall, this program showcases the core principles of linked list data structures and serves as a reliable foundation for implementing more advanced data handling tasks in C.
